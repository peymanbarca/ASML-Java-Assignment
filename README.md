We want to solve a problem which is about the spiral presentation of a given 2D array in clock-wise manner.

Using two general approaches in order to solve the problem

    1. Iterative Approach
    
    2. Recursive Approach
    
Also, we suggest using DFS algorithm in order to solve in recursive manner with different approach than solution 2.
